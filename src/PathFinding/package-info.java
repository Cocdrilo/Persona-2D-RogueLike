/**
 * The {@code PathFinding} package provides classes for implementing pathfinding algorithms in the game.
 * It includes classes representing nodes in a graph and a pathfinder for finding optimal paths.
 *
 * <p>The main classes in this package are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link PathFinding.Node} - Represents a node in a graph used for pathfinding algorithms.</li>
 *   <li>{@link PathFinding.PathFinder} - Implements a pathfinder for finding optimal paths in the game environment.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@link PathFinding.Node} is a class specifically designed to model nodes in a graph.
 * It is an essential component for pathfinding algorithms, representing points in the game environment that can be traversed.
 *
 * <p>{@link PathFinding.PathFinder} is a class that implements pathfinding algorithms to find optimal paths between points in the game.
 * It uses the information from {@link PathFinding.Node} instances to determine the most efficient routes for characters or entities.
 *
 * <p>Each class in this package contributes to the implementation of pathfinding capabilities within the game.
 * Pathfinding is crucial for determining the optimal movement of characters or entities in a dynamic game world.
 *
 * @version 1.0
 * @since 2023-11-27
